      <h2>Our Vision</h2>
      <p className="text-sm sm:text-base">
        AI is the new electricity and has the potential to transform multiple industries. We believe we are entering one of the greatest eras of technology.
      </p>
      <p className="text-sm sm:text-base">
        While we hear a lot about potential use cases and how AI is going to automate everything, much of the value in AI is still untapped and undiscovered.
        To unleash the potential of AI, we are bridging the gap between research and real-world applications by building the application layer for AI.
      </p>
      
      <h3 className="mt-6 sm:mt-8 md:mt-10">Our Approach</h3>
      <p className="text-sm sm:text-base">
        Flexible Functions is an industrial research and development AI lab building practical use cases using current state-of-the-art machine learning 
        systems in different domains. We do this while researching how to build new user products and experiences while integrating the use of cutting-edge 
        foundation models.
      </p>
      <p className="text-sm sm:text-base">
        We expect the practical aspect of building use cases for AI will inform research on how to take advantage of AI to build new products and experiences 
        and how to tackle the challenges that currently prevent AI from being more prevalent across various industries.

        Supply chains today are more vulnerable to unforeseen shocks/disruptions be it pandemics, wars, climate change, etc. 
        Overstocking leads to wasted inventory, tied-up capital, missed opportunities for fulfillment, and dissatisfied customers.
